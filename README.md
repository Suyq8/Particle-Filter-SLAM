Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is an important topic in robotics. It tries to utilize sensor data and user input to estimate the agentâ€™s state and update a map of the surrounding environment at the same time. With the improvements in computing speed on end-devices and the availability of low-cost sensors, its algorithms are now widely used in robot navigation, robot mapping, and autonomous vehicles.

In this project, we propose a solution for SLAM using particle filter. Besides, we build a texture map by projecting RBG color in the stereo image pairs onto the map. The solution is then evaluated using data collected by an autonomous car.
